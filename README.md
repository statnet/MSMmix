## Impact of Assortative Mixing on HIV Prevalence and Incidence among MSM

This repository holds the source to code to reproduce the RShiny application demonstrating the nature of inter-group disparities in infection rates over time. Specifically, we aim to illustrate how the ability for any phenomenon to sustain a pre-existing disparity is linked to its ability to generate a disparity when none exists. Examples of the kinds of phenomena we mean are differences in care access (and thus in infectiousness per contact and/or mortality rates), differences in contact rates, differences in access to and use of prevention modalities like condoms (and thus in effective contact rates), and assortative mixing between the two groups. The code to reproduce this is stored in a GitHub repository called [MSMMix](https://github.com/statnet/MSMmix).
